# Space Y

## Overview
- Collected data from public SpaceX API and SpaceX Wikipedia page. Cleaned data and gathered relevant columns to be used as features to predict successful landings.

- Explored data using SQL, visualization, folium maps, and dashboard(click to see). Explored and visualized the correlation between successful landings and other features.

- Four machine learning models were produced: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Classifier, and K Nearest Neighbors to predict successful landings.

- Used GridSearchCV to find the best parameters for machine learning models. All models had similar results, with an accuracy rate of about 83.33%.

## Code and Resources Used
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm
- Packages: pandas, numpy, BeautifulSoup, sqlite3, folium, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dash, sklearn
